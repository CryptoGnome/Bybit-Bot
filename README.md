Liquidation Hunter is a little bot written in Python that looks at
the liquidation feed via the Bitmex API for larger liquidation events
and counter trades them on Bybit where there is ZERO API friction and
we are able to get orders in very quickly without over load.

The theory is to trade very volatile moves when there are liquidations
present and get in quickly with a market order and use a tight Take Profit 
and Stop Loss. (Ride the Wave Dudddde)

*ANY results are based on simulated or hypothetical performance results that have certain inherent limitations. Unlike the results shown in an actual performance record, these results do not represent actual trading. Also, because these trades have not actually been executed, these results may have under-or over-compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity. Simulated or hypothetical trading programs in general are also subject to the fact that they are designed with the benefit of hindsight. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to these being shown.*
